<p>
  At Steadline Recovery, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
  your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle information
  when you visit our website.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Information We Collect</h2>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Personal Information</h3>
<p>
  We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or
  payment details through this website. However, we do collect some anonymous
  usage data as described below.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Analytics Data</h3>
<p>
  We use Umami Analytics to understand how visitors use our website. Umami is a
  privacy-focused analytics service that collects:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 my-4">
  <li>Pages visited and time spent on pages</li>
  <li>Referring websites and search terms</li>
  <li>Browser type and operating system</li>
  <li>Country/region (based on IP address, which is not stored)</li>
  <li>Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Umami does not use cookies, does not collect
  personal information, and cannot track you across other websites. Your IP
  address is processed only to determine your general location (country level)
  and is not stored.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Website Interactions</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 my-4">
  <li>
    <strong>Call Us button</strong>: Clicking this opens your phone's dialer. We
    do not record or store any call data â€” though your phone provider may
    process call information according to their policies.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
<p>
  Under GDPR, we process analytics data based on our legitimate interest in
  understanding website usage to improve our services (Article 6(1)(f)). This
  processing is minimal, anonymous, and does not pose risks to your privacy.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>
  This website does not use cookies. We use Umami Analytics, which is a
  cookieless analytics solution that does not store any information on your
  device or track you across websites. No consent banner is required as no
  personal data is stored on your device.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Data Retention</h2>
<p>
  Anonymous analytics data is retained for 24 months for statistical purposes,
  after which it is automatically deleted.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
<p>
  Since we only process anonymous, non-personal data through this website, most
  GDPR rights do not apply to our website analytics. However, you have the right
  to:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 my-4">
  <li>
    <strong>Opt-out</strong>: You can disable JavaScript in your browser to
    prevent analytics collection
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Object</strong>: Contact us if you object to anonymous analytics
    collection
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you contact us directly (by phone or email), you have full GDPR rights
  regarding any personal data you provide, including the right to access,
  rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and object to
  processing.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
  Analytics data is processed by Umami, which may be hosted outside the EU. Any
  transfers comply with GDPR requirements through appropriate safeguards.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>
  Our website may contain links to external sites. Please review the privacy
  policies of those sites when you visit them, as we are not responsible for
  their data practices.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Contact Us</h2>

  rights, contact us:
